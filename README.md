## What about Brew? 🍺🍺

Brew is awesome, check it out here: [Brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

Brew is a great tool for users who have administrative rights on their devices, or know how to configure for non-default installation. In other cases, it is likely the only administrators are via IT and their management systems. These scripts require sudo level access due to some of the commands being run, so they are mainly for those with additional permissions on their devices.

## JAMF Pro

These scripts work very well in JAMF Pro as an easy way to install software without needing to send much from your fileshare. In addition, they are very easy to make available in Self Service and easily can be maintained in a git repo - you should check out [git2jss](https://marketplace.jamf.com/details/git2jss/).

If managing scripts via git2jss, you will need to follow the structure used by JAMF below.

```
Script_Name
 ┣ script.sh
 ┗ script.xml
```

The `script.sh` houses the contents of your shell scripts and your `script.xml` contains the information used to populate the fields in JAMF Pro. Some examples are the name, category, description, specific naming for variables, etc.

## Installation logging & Interpretation

By default, the installation scripts will log to `/Library/Logs/Install/` with their respective names. To quickly see what failed, the log files will have macOS Finder Tags with the following colors and meanings.

| Tag Color | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yellow    | Script started to run. If the script finished and the tag is still yellow, then there was likely something that caused it to exit before finishing installation. |
| Green     | Script completed sucessfully.                                                                                                                                    |
| Red       | Script failed according to the cleanAndValidate function. More information on the next log line.                                                                 |

## About the Project

I am college student who has worked part-time as a student system administrator for macOS with JAMF Pro as the MDM provider. This project is simply a way to continue writing and cleaning up scripts that I find useful. All scripts have been tested on macOS Big Sur.

## Future Plans for this Project (\*)

- Create a better function for closing applications that handles several cases.
- Add additional application installers, management scripts, and other scripts.
- Add script to convert all scripts to the format required for uploading to JAMF via their API.
